Carrying out streamlined routine data analyses with reports for observational studies: introduction to a series of generic SAS® macros

For a typical medical research project based on observational data, sequential routine analyses are often essential to comprehend the data on hand and to draw valid conclusions.  However, generating reports in SAS® for routine analyses can be a time-consuming and tedious process, especially when dealing with large databases with a massive number of variables in an iterative and collaborative research environment. In this work, we present a general workflow of research based on an observational database and a series of SAS® macros that fits this framework, which covers a streamlined data analyses and produces journal-quality summary tables. The system is generic enough to fit a variety of research projects and enables researchers to build a highly organized and concise coding for quick updates as research evolves. The result reports promote communication in collaborations and will escort the research with ease and efficiency.

This repository contains all proposed SAS macros along with the dataset and example code as shown in the manuscript/publication.
